Latitude		Center of 1km fire pixel but not necessarily the actual location of the fire as one or more fires can be detected within the 1km pixel.
Longitude 	Center of 1km fire pixel but not necessarily the actual location of the fire as one or more fires can be detected within the 1km pixel.
Brightness	Channel 21/22 brightness temperature of the fire pixel measured in Kelvin.
Acq_Date		Data of MODIS acquisition.
Confidence	This value is based on a collection of intermediate algorithm quantities used in the detection process. It is intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Confidence estimates range between 0 and 100% and are assigned one of the three fire classes (low-confidence fire, nominal-confidence fire, or high-confidence fire).
FRP	        Depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (megawatts).
